                    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, object-oriented, interpreted programming language that utilizes
                        just-in-time compilation with first-class functions. Best known as the scripting language used
                        for web page behavior, it also has non-browser environment uses as well. Exploring this
                        technical documentation page will help you understand what <em>exactly</em> makes JavaScript the
                        unique programming language that it is. Enjoy!

                <header class="h1">JavaScript vs. Java</header>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, JavaScript is not "interpreted Java". Java is typically utilized in
                    server-side development, whereas Javascript predominently handles the development of client-side
                    scripting for functions that increase a web page's interactivity. With that said, the creation of of
                    Node.js has allowed developers to increasingly use JavaScript to run server-side scripts for various
                    tools and applications. Some other key differences between JavaScript and Java include:</p>
                </br>
                <ul>
                    <li>While both Java and JavaScript can run on browsers and servers alike, JavaScript is known to run
                        on browsers in order to enhance the user experience, whereas Java is known to be a web and
                        application server workhorse</li>
                    <li>Java is designed to allow developers to write code once and deploy it to any operating system
                        without having to make changes. While this is not a failproof process, JavaScript is more
                        sensitive to differences in execution environments, such as browser compatibility issues, which
                        requires more individualized coding</li>
                    <li>Java is a language that is compiled prior to being run, meaning it will be compiled to bytecode
                        or machine code before being executed. Thus any structural issues with the code are recognized
                        rather quickly, and once the code is running, developers can attach to the virtual machine and
                        debug in real-time. JavaScript uses just-in-time compilation which means code translation occurs
                        just before runtime. Bugs are then found at runtime and debugging capabilities are highly
                        dependent on the execution environment which will vary widely among developers.</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
                <header class="h1">Hello World</header>
                <p>To begin writing in JavaScript, open your IDE and write the code shown below in a <em>.js</em> file.
                    Create a script for the .js file in your <em>.html</em> file and open the .html file in your
                    browser. You will see an alert pop up with the greeting "Hello World":
                <pre class="code-example">
        <code>
        function greetMe(yourName) { 
        alert("Hello" + yourName); 
        }
        greetMe("World");</code>
        </pre>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="lexical-structure">
                <header class="h1">Lexical Structure</header>
                <p>It is important to understand the basic rules of how to write programs in a language in order to help
                    the program run effectively and efficiently without creating unnecessary bugs that can be difficult
                    to locate. These rules are terms the lexical structure of Javascript and they include the following:
                </p>
                </br>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript is a case-sensitive language, which means paying attention to when and how you
                        capitalize words. For example, the keyword <em>function</em> must be typed as "function", not
                        "Function" or "FUNCTION". When two words are combined in the naming of variables and functions,
                        it is best practice to write in <em>camelCase</em> to easily differentiate words</li>
                    <li>Comments provide context to code and are styled in such a way that JavaScript knows to ignore
                        the text as code is executed. A single-line comment is delimited by "//" at the beginning of the
                        line, whereas a multi-line comment's text falls between a pair of "/*" characters: </li>
                    <pre class="code-example">
            <code>
            // this is a comment

            /* this is also
            a comment */</code>
            </pre>

                    <li>Identifiers are used to name variables, functions, constants, properties, classes and to label
                        certain loops. Identifiers must begin with a letter, underscore (_) or dollar sign ($)</li>
                    <li>Keywords are words that cannot be used as identifiers because they already have special meaning
                        and can only be used in certain contexts in JavaScript. A full list of available keywords is
                        outside the scope of this document, however, examples include <em>const, function, for, get,
                            return </em>and <em>while</em>.</li>
                    <li>The Unicode character set (composed of letters, digits and ideographs) is used in JavaScript to
                        create identifiers, strings and to write comments about the code itself. When certain computer
                        software or hardware cannot display or process a full set of Unicode characters, four-digit
                        Unicode escape sequences can be used. These are written with the characters "\u" followed by
                        four hexicdemical digits or by one to six hexidemical digits enclosed within curly braces. For
                        example, the "é" in "touché" can be written in the following two ways:</li>
                    <pre class="code-example">
            <code>
            touch\u00e9
            touch\u{E9}</code>
            </pre>
                    <li>Semicolons are at times considered optional in JavaScript, but they can be necessary for
                        separating statements. For example, in the instance of a single line of code that has more than
                        one statement, a semi-colon is needed to provide separation between them:
                        <pre class="code-example">
                <code>
                a = 6; b = 8;</code>
                </pre>
                        Generally speaking, JavaScript will interpret a line break as a semicolon when it cannot parse
                        the code as a continuation of the first statement. In situations where a new statement begins
                        with parentheses () or square brackets [] JavaScript can get confused and assign it to the first
                        statement. As such, some programmers will proactively use a semicolon at the beginning of the
                        second line to explictly separate the statements:
                    </li>
                    <pre class="code-example">
                <code>
                let x = y + f
                ;(a+b).toString()</code>
                </pre>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="variables">
                <header class="h1">Variables</header>
                <p>A variable is a symbolic name assigned to a value and values can take many different forms. These
                    include:</p>
                </br>
                <ul>
                    <li>numbers (intergers and real numbers)</li>
                    <li>boolean (true/false) values</li>
                    <li>strings of text within double or single quotation marks</li>
                    <li>null ("no value") values</li>
                    <li>undefined values</li>
                </ul>
                </br>
                <p>Variables are declared with keywords var, let or const. In the code example below, variable
                    <em>x</em> is assigned to the string value <em>"hello world"</em> via the <em>let</em> keyword:</p>
                <pre class="code-example">
                <code>
                let x = "hello world";</code>
                </pre>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
                <header class="h1">Variable Scope</header>
                <scope>Scope refers to the extent that a defined variable is visible to other source code. An example of
                    a variable with <em>global</em> scope is one that is defined outside of a function and can be used
                    by any function without passing it to the function as a parameter:
                    <pre class="code-example">

        <code>const name = "kaitycodes";</code>
        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p><em>Local</em> scope, on the other hand, refers to a variable that is defined within a function
                        and can only be used within the function that defines it:
                    <pre class="code-example">

        <code>function makeFunc() {
        const myName = "kaitycodes";
        }</code>
        </pre>
                    </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="functions">
                <header class="h1">Functions</header>
                <p>Functions are named and parameterized blocks of code that can are defined once and then invoked as
                    many times as desired. Function statements are enclosed in curly braces, as seen above in the code
                    example for Variable Scope. It is important to remember that the code inside of a function is only
                    executed when it is invoked or called:</p>
